    "We will start  with toy data generated from an LNP model neuron to make sure everything works right. The model LNP neuron consists of one Gaussian linear filter, an exponential nonlinearity and a Poisson spike count generator. We look at it in discrete time with time bins of width $\\delta t$. The model is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, $c_t$ is the spike count in time window $t$ of length $\\Delta t$, $s_t$ is the stimulus and $w$ is the receptive field of the neuron. The receptive field variable `w` is 15 × 15 pixels and normalized to $||w||=1$. A stimulus frame is a 15 × 15 pixel image, for which we use uncorrelated checkerboard noise. R can be used to bring the firing rate into the right regime (e.g. by setting $R=50$).   \n",
    "\n",
    "For computational ease, we reformat the stimulus and the receptive field in a 225 by 1 array. The function ```sampleLNP``` can be used to generate data from this model. It returns a spike count vector `c` with samples from the model (dimensions: 1 by nT = $T/\\Delta t$), a stimulus matrix `s` (dimensions: 225 × nT) and the mean firing rate `r` (dimensions: nT × 1). \n",

    "Here we assume that the receptive field influences the spike count instantaneously just as in the above equations. Implement a Maximum Likelihood approach to fit the receptive field. \n",
